#Restaurant Data Analysis
This project is focused on analyzing restaurant data using Python. It covers a range of exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, statistical calculations, and visualization, with the goal of understanding trends related to restaurant ratings, cuisines, price ranges, and services like table booking and online delivery.

Prerequisites To run the project, you will need to have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn folium You can install these libraries using pip:

bash Copy code pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn folium Files Dataset.csv: The CSV file containing restaurant data, including columns like restaurant name, city, cuisines, average cost, ratings, and service options. cognifyz technologies - Colab.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the main code for data analysis and visualization. Project Structure Task 1: Data Loading and Initial Exploration Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. Perform basic exploration to view the structure of the data, including checking for missing values and summarizing the data. Task 2: Statistical Analysis Calculate basic statistics for the dataset such as mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical columns (restaurant ID, average cost, votes, etc.). Display top cities and cuisines based on the number of restaurants. Analyze country codes by cuisine and calculate the most common cuisines in different regions. Task 3: Visualization Use the folium library to create a map displaying restaurant locations based on latitude and longitude. Plot the number of restaurants by city using Seaborn for a bar plot. Analyze the relationship between price range and services like online delivery and table booking. Calculate and visualize the average rating by price range and determine the highest rating color. Key Insights The most common cuisine in the dataset is North Indian, followed by North Indian & Chinese. The city with the most restaurants in the dataset is New Delhi, followed by Gurgaon and Noida. Around 12% of restaurants support table booking, while 25% offer online delivery. The price range most common among restaurants is 1, which has an average rating of 3.73 (on a scale where "Excellent" = 7 and "Poor" = 1). How to Run the Project Open the Jupyter notebook in Google Colab or any other environment that supports Jupyter. Load the dataset. Run the code cells to perform the analysis and generate visualizations. Future Improvements Further analysis can be done by adding more visualizations and exploring relationships between other variables like location and average cost. Integrating machine learning models to predict restaurant ratings based on available data.
